    <h3>Decide the Fate of the World</h3>
    <p> <b>Alliance</b> challenges you and your opponents to decide
        the outcome. As one of the world powers
        battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
        military drive; but you can't do it alone.
        You have to form alliances and then betray your
        allies before they betray you!</p>
    <p> Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
        of the strike. Will it be a bombing
        raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion
        with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack,
        move into enemy territory with your forces and win
        the conflict.</p>
    <p>The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake.
        Buy armaments and develop secret
        weapons from your country's economic funds and
        natural reserves, but be sure to save
        something for the future.</p>

    <h3 class="ident">Tedious and Confusing</h3>
    <p class="ident">The list of war simulation games is long. All of them
        share similar features including the
        formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated
        through random draws of a deck or the
        roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that
        is new or innovative in that regard.</p>
    <p class="ident">We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing.
        In fact, I dare say we spent more time
        reading and rereading the rule book than actually
        playing the game. If you want to read a
        book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.</p>

    <h3 class="ident">Decent Game but Many are Better</h3>
    <p class="ident">Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the
        game play to be robust and engaging. The
        rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with
        experience in this class of board games, there
        is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We
        think the battle simulation cards are some of
        the best we have encountered.</p>
    <p class="ident">All of that being said, the competition for this type
        of game is fierce. There are a lot of
        established titles with loyal clients. We're not
        exactly sure where Alliance fits in with
        that group. It's a good game, but not good enough
        to draw our attention away from games like
        Battle Tested and Global Conflict.</p>

    <h3 class="ident">Fun and Challenging</h3>
    <p class="ident">Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to
        war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new
        ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the
        investment options give the game a "real world" feel.</p>
    <p class="ident">Things We Liked</p>
    <ul class="ident">
        <li class="ident">Variety of Battle Scenarios</li>
        <li class="ident">Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
        <li class="ident">Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>
        <li class="ident">Wealth of Expansion Packs</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="ident">Things We Hated</p>
    <li class="ident">Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
    <li class="ident">Setup takes too Long</li>

    <p class="ident">This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules
        and may be bored</p>
