    <h3>Rule an Ancient City</h3>
    <p><b>Towers and Temples</b> is the winner of the 2017 Palmer
        Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game.
        Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient
        Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage
        the administration of a city. Each role provides
        a different ability and strategy. However,
        one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players
        must be constantly aware of betrayal
        and double-cross. This card game provides a ton
        of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players
        and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>
    <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must
        carefully choose his or her roles and
        the strategies can quickly change with the turn
        of a card. However the level of randomness is
        just right and cunning and resourcefulness can
        overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not
        recommend this game unless there are at least 4
        players; less than that reduces the intrigue
        and some of the game appeal.</p>

        Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is
        just about perfect and each player must
        carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the
        strategic possibilities are nearly endless,
        the game is simple to learn. The replay value is
        high and gets even better when you replace
        some of the cards with new cards available in the
        expansion packs.

    <h3 class="ident"> Great Strategic Board Game</h3>
    <p class="ident"> We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2
        to 6 players and we can strongly
        recommend the game. The different phases of the
        game are interesting and intriguing, from
        bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning.
        With the variety of cards and
        scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's
        a great introduction to the world of
        strategic board games and role playing.</p>

    <h3 class="ident">An Incredible Game</h3>
    <p class="ident"> The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent
        and one of the best around. As
        for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there
        are tough decisions to make every
        turn. It's not only important to select the character
        that increases your chances for scoring,
        but also to anticipate the characters the opponents
        are likely to select, and then hedge against
        their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability
        and deep strategic thinking. However,
        it can still be played at a more basic level for
        younger users.
    </p>
    <p class="ident">We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as
        Best in its Class. Highly recommended.
